My Visual Argument is meant to express the need that Pitt students have for more efficient ENS alerts during campus emergencies. I want to show how little the Pitt administration has been doing to alert students in light of the recent violence on and around campus. I plan to use several visual assets and then combine them with my tag line “Real time ENS alerts for real student safety” for my desired effect. I want to make the administration aware that students desperately want to be given adequate time to stay away from areas of danger so that we can feel safer on campus. (I don’t plan to post this on social media or around campus so you don’t have to worry about either of us getting in trouble)
